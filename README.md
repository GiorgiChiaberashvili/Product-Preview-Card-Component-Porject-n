## MyPhilosophy

Never giving up and keep pushing further

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Block
- and with bunch of Love.

### What I learned

I want to start practicising Tailwind but I think I am not yet done with Vanilla CSS. I will keep practicising until I feel comfortable to switch to another level.

HTML Basics: Nothing new for HTML part, the process of setting up the visual is becoming increasingly easier with every next project.

CSS Basics: THe only new detailed learned was text-decoration: line-through
